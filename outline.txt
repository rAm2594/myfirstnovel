Chapter-1
Minas Tirith, formerly and eventually again known as Minas Anor, was the capital city of Gondor from TA 1640 onward.
In the year SA 3429, Sauron invaded Gondor, capturing Minas Ithil and forcing Isildur to flee. Anárion successfully defended Osgiliath and retook Minas Ithil, driving Sauron back for a time, but in the following War of the Last Alliance, Anárion was slain and rule of Gondor passed to his descendants, who would continue to rule from Osgiliath. Before departing for the north, Isildur planted the White Tree of Gondor in the Court of the Fountain in memory of his slain brother.
